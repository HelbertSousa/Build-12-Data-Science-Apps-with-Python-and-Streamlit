# Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit

This repository was created with the purpose of tracking learning through the use of data science and machine learning tools, also making use of the Streamlit tool that facilitates the design of web applications.

That said, I am following the development through a video provided by the YouTube channel called [dataprofessor](https://www.youtube.com/dataprofessor), which has its branch on the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-12-data-science-apps-with-python-and-streamlit/) website through the link :
